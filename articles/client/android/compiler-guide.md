## Requirements

- Android Studio 1.5.0–2.2.3

## Steps

1. Download Android Studio (modern versions don't work)
2. Fix build.gradle — add mavenCentral and Fabric plugin
3. Add icon resource (Roblox didn't include icons in all builds)
4. Fix NDK path in android/nativeshell/build.gradle — point runNDKBuild() to your NDK
